# Medical-Infusion-Pump
The objective of designing the medical infusion pump is to develop the circuit designing and programming skills. It also helped us to learn the utilization of our skills for the well being of mankind. Keypad, LCD, interrupts and microcontrollers are very important part of digital circuits. So in this project we utilized these items to get complete grasp on them. The idea of the project is very simple. The user selects the infusion rate with the help of buttons on a key pad. The selected rate is displayed on a connected LCD Display. Only one button is pressed at a time and the corresponding displayed digit is incremented on each button press. If the button is held down the corresponding displayed digit will increment after each half second. When a “START” button is pressed, the system generates drive impulses to a uni-polar stepper motor .When the “STOP” button is pressed the drive and hence actuator stops movement
